# Experiment evidence

No project experiments have been executed while preparing this pack. Link each actual experiment's hypothesis, source revision/dirty snapshot, environment, model identity, controls, commands, raw outputs, repetitions, observations, and limitations. Keep raw data immutable and distinguish Mac, Colab, mock, replayed, and estimated results.

## Day 1 engineering checks — 2026-10-27 America/Toronto

Run `mac-day1-offline-20261027-1309`: Python 3.14.5, macOS 26.5.2, local project venv; `.venv/bin/pytest -q` returned 15 passed, one Starlette deprecation warning in 0.23 seconds. Mock HTTP transports supplied backend responses; these are not model experiments.

Run `mac-day1-offline-20261027-1314`: after `uv sync --locked`, `uv run --extra test pytest -q` returned 15 passed, one warning in 0.16 seconds. Raw output: `evidence/day1/mac-offline-20261027-1314.txt`. Doctor's raw JSON is `evidence/day1/mac-doctor-20261027-1314.json` (exit status 1 because models are unavailable).

Run `mac-day1-health-20261027-1310`: a brief real localhost gateway process returned HTTP 200 and `{"status":"ok"}` from `/healthz`. Initial default-sandbox bind failed with EPERM; an authorized elevated loopback run succeeded. No backend was called.

Run `mac-day1-doctor-20261027-1308`: both Ollama tiers returned `ConnectError`; frontier was disabled. Colab and paid-provider runs: none.
